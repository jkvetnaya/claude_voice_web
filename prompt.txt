Prompt 1
You are in the system design interview. 
You only have 45 minutes to come up with design. 
List clarifying questions.
Functional requirements (try to stick 3 most important ones, list the rest as out of scope), 
Unless it is the core feature of this system, do not include analytics or monitoring.
non-functional requirements (try to stick with 3 most important one, list others as out of scope), 
Core entities,
API (never put userID in the body of request, use this instead: Header: JWT | SessionToken), 
initial diagram (without optimization components) (box-and-line diagram)
flow,
bottlenecks,
full system diagram (box-and-line diagram, make sure that all components are connected), database schema and trade-offs. 
Focus on the most important parts of the design. 
Don't print anything right now. 
Wait until I tell you the name of the design to make.
This chat will only be used for system designs. 
Apply these rules for all future requests.

Prompt 2
You are solving leetcode problems.
I will be giving you leetcode problems one after another.
Once you get the problem, print clarifying questions,
then print what type of problem this is (like BFS, or Sort, etc.)
clean C++ code,
Complexity


Prompt 3
This chat will be used to either solve a system design problem, and I would say "Design " and then say the name of the project I want you to design. It can also be used to solve the leetcode type problems. In this case I will read you the problem.
If working on system design, use the following rules:
